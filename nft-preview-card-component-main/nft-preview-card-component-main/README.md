![Design preview for the NFT preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

## Description

This project features a NFT preview card component that I have recreated using Frontend Mentor's image example.

### Continued development

From this project, I was able to improve upon my design skills and gain inspiration from modern design aspects. To broaden my design skills, I will learn to animate my designs to bring my designs to life.


### Useful resources

- [A Guide To Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me refresh my understanding of Flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
